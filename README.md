# Freebie bot

Discord bot for grabbing free games from reddit posts.

Bot requires following permissions:

- Read messages
- Send messages
- Read message history

## Using the bot

1. Add the bot to your server using this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=755888875171217589&permissions=68608&scope=bot).
2. Create a text channel named `freebie-bot`.
3. Make sure bot has rights to read and write to this channel.

Now the bot will start putting messages about freebies from [/r/GameDeals](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/).

## Rationale for manually creating a channel

In order for bot to be able to create channels, you have to allow him to **modify channels**. Some people (including myself) find it suspicious to provide such permissions, thus you have to create the channel yourself.

## Running your own copy

Currently, bot is under development and this option is not available. Howerver, you can use [my bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=755888875171217589&permissions=68608&scope=bot) on your server if you want.
